This program is drawn from a lesson in my advanced python class. To run, have all scripts in the same folder and run game.py

game.py: Central script that cordinates the program.

Board.py: Handles the state of the board.

Player.py: Handles player input.

AI.py: Handles AI control of the game, includes the random selection algorithm.

MiniMax.py: Algorithm that selects locations through a minmax algorithm, including simulating multiple games.

SmartAI.py: This file was done as extra credit, with minimal guidance from course material. Based on a solved tic-tac-toe algorithm found on Wikipedia.
